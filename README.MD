# MTG-API
Backend code for an MTG Inventory app being built on stream over on [TWITCH](https://www.twitch.tv/zer0xeon)

## Setup
1.  Download the SQLite Version of the All Printings database from [here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/)
2.  Put it in the same folder as the code.
3.  Run `npm install`
4.  Run `npm start` to start the dev server, it will default to port 1999.

## Notes
To change the port go into `config.ini` and change the port value.
If you wish to disable the high level of verbosity, set debug to false.

HAPPY TRAILS!
